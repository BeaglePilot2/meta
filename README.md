## About -

The aim of the project is to create an open hardware underwater vehicle based on [BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/black). The project will involve using the [Erle Brain](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/erle-brain/) to provide autopilot capabilities. The project will enable hobbyists to get access to a low cost, easy to use and open hardware underwater vehicle platform with autopilot capabilities which they can modify according to their needs and requirements.
